This repository currently contains both python scripts and latex sources for a report on the financial viability of lithium ion based batteries in conjunction with solar power for the BÃ¼rgerEnergiegenossenschaft Karlsruhe Ettlingen eV.

All python scripts are intended to be executed from the repository's root directory.
To initialize the raw data:
* run "python ./data/populate-prices.py" to populate the energy prices files in ./data/prices/
* run "python ./data/production/convert_csv.py" to generate the production data from its sources in ./data/production/BEG Buchtzig.csv
Then, to generate the graphs and evaluation results:
* run "python ./scripts/evaluate_prices.py" to get the results in ./results/price-analysis/
* run "python ./scripts/evaluate_buchtzig.py" to get the results of the full simulation

## TODO:
* actually latexmk the current report state
* complete the report by filling in all the latex source files
* optimize the online algorithm used in the buchtzig evaluation
* generally try out and compare multiple specific setups in the buchtzig evaluation
* add real-world cost estimates for acquisition, installation and additional costs such as fire safety costs to the report
* write a short presentation in addition to the full report
